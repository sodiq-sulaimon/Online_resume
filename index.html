    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3><li>Multithreaded File Transfer Library in C</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Built a multithreaded HTTP-like server and client file transfer library on TCP with boss-worker multithreading model.</li>
            <li>Server: Implemented a handler that works as the boss thread that adds requests to a shared queue that is synchronized with a lock and conditional variable. Pool of worker threads are created based on the number specified by the user to process client requests concurrently.</li>
            <li>Client: “main” acts as the boss thread that adds requests to a synchronized shared queue. The worker threads are responsible for sending requests to the server and handling the response.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3><li>Database Schema Design & Migration with PostgreSQL and Node.js</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed a database schema for an Instagram-like social network application and implemented it using PostgreSQL.</li>
            <li>Optimized access paths with indexes that resulted in reduction in query latency by over 14 times with minimal impact on memory usage.</li>
            <li>Migrated data and schema for the database in phases using migration files in Node.js.</li>            
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3><li>Distributed Spanning Tree & Distance Vector Routing Protocols in Python</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Implemented a simplified, distributed spanning tree algorithm to eliminate forwarding loops in switches (Layer 2 topology). Switches communicate with neighbors and block redundant paths, ensuring a single active path between any two nodes.</li>
            <li>Implemented a packet routing protocol using the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Routers exchange routing tables with neighbors via message passing, with automatic convergence upon achieving consistent network state.</li>          
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3><li>Cache Performance & Coherence Protocols in C++</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Implemented Next Least Recently Used (NXLRU) and Least Recently Used (LRU) cache replacement policies in the SESC simulator to gain insights into their impact on cache performance and efficiency.</li>
            <li>Implemented cache miss categorization (coherence, compulsory, capacity, and conflict) for MESI coherence protocol to enhance my understanding of cache behavior and multi-core system performance.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3><li>Customers Request Prediction App in Python </li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Built a full-stack web application for customer request prediction on an e-commerce platform. Built the API endpoints using Flask and Python, and the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Integrated a machine learning model with >85% accuracy in the backend, containerized the application with Docker, and deployed it on Heroku.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
